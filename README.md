# ddev-mutagen

Uses mutagen to sync files into and out of a ddev web container and completely
bypasses osxfs or nfs.

## Usage

1. Read the setup script. It's really short and won't take you very much time.
2. No, seriously. Go read it. You're about to pipe commands from a stranger on the internet into your computer.
3. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cweagans/ddev-mutagen/master/setup.sh | bash`

Wait, you didn't read it before you ran it? Are you crazy?
